Ahoy World
==========

Welcome me hearties!
This application represents a platform that we will integrate into Zend Server 6, using nothing but a keyboard and a few presentation slides.

One class of interest exists here:
Ahoy\Mapper\Activity which has two methods used to control the application's activity flag

This application does absolutely nothing else

Installation
------------

Zend Deployment - Download the zpk file in the root of the project and use Zend's UI or WebAPI to deploy the application directly

Alternatively, you may download the zip file from github and install to a directory of your choice.
Note that using this method may require you to sort out your ZF2 autoloading manually
